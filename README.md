Part 1 has implementation of algorithm to to play game of Pikachu which is a simplified version of a chess. <br />
Part 2 has implementation of algorithm for following problem: <br />
- For Part 2, the goal was to finish the code for the SebastianAutoPlayer, so that the program would play the game of Sebastian in such a way that gets the best score possible. This problem was unique in the sense that it is not a search problem, where states are explored via a search algorithm for a goal state. When we initially met to discuss the problem, we figured that the problem would involve expected value computations. Broadly, we figured that expected value calculations would be needed to "guide" decision-making for the algorithm. This approach was further clarified by the discussion video on games of chance, where Professor Crandall showed how he reasoned through a similar problem. That video was further inspiration for our approach. <br />

Part 3 has implementation of algorithm for finding spam emails. <br />
